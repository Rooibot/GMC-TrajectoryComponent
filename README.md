# Trajectory Movement Component

This is a subclass of the `UGMC_OrganicMovementCmp` from the (currently in beta) General Movement Component v2; it will handle distance matching prediction and collect motion trajectory samples, suitable for distance matching, animation warping, and such. It's in a VERY early state, and is offered only because after discussion over on the GMC Discord it's become clear it may be of use to my fellow GMCv2 licensees.

It will _not_ work without GMCv2, of course.
